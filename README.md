# 42Piscine
During the Piscine at 42Malaga, I had the opportunity to challenge myself with 12 (+2) unique projects in the C programming language.

The Piscine is a learning experience in which the participants should seek help from their peers, and refrain to copy and paste code from who-knows-where.
Therefore, this is a repository with the projects I was able to finish back in July 2022. Every project will have a README with the score.

Please, if you're reading this while participating in a Piscine at any 42 school, I encourage you to try and think the projects for yourself and with the help of other people in your campus.
If you're still determined to use this repo as a guide, don't copy any code you don't understand. We don't want a "Cheat" score, do we?
Also, subjects will not be provided within this repo. They might have changed since my Piscine, so there's that.
